# Dogsheep

Dogsheep is a collection of tools for *personal analytics* using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and [Datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette).

Big internet companies know a *lot* about us. By exporting that data back out of them we can see what they know and maybe learn something interesting about ourselves.

## Dogsheep tools

These tools, maintained by the Dogsheep project, let you export your data into a SQLite database for further analysis.
